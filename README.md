# Python Coding

Welcome to my Python Coding Portfolio! This repository is a collection of Python projects and source codes that demonstrate various programming concepts, ranging from fundamental algorithms and data structures to GUI development and statistical analysis.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized into three main categories:

### 1. PyQt6 (`/PyQt6`)
Contains source code for Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications built using the PyQt6 framework.
* **PyQT6 Practice.py**: A starter application featuring a window with input fields, buttons, and text output, demonstrating event handling (signals and slots).
* **PyQt6 Practice UI.ui**: The accompanying user interface file created with Qt Designer.

### 2. Temperature Logger Problem (`/Temperature Logger Problem`)
A specialized problem-solving script focused on array manipulation and data calculation.
* **Temperature Logger.py**: Uses **NumPy** to create a 3D array structure for logging temperatures across multiple floors and rooms over specific time intervals. It calculates and outputs average temperatures per room.

### 3. Python Practice (`/Python Practice`)
A diverse collection of scripts covering data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data science.

#### Data Structures & Systems
* **NSTP Application and Attendance Tracker (v1.2)**: A comprehensive system using **Linked Lists** to manage student registrations, admin logins, and attendance tracking for the National Service Training Program.
* **Linked List Training.py**: Implementation of a singly linked list with methods to append (head, mid, end) and delete nodes.
* **Bank Account Balance Tracker.py**: An OOP example demonstrating class methods for deposits, withdrawals, and balance updates.

#### Data Science & Statistics
* **InferentialStat.py**: A robust statistical analysis tool capable of performing **Z-Tests**, **T-Tests**, **One-Way ANOVA**, and **Linear Regression** (Simple and Multiple). It utilizes `scipy`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib` for calculations and plotting.
* **Matplotlib Introduction.py**: Demonstrates data visualization techniques using the Matplotlib library.

#### Algorithms & Utilities
* **FCFS.py**: Implementation of the **First-Come, First-Served** CPU scheduling algorithm, calculating turnaround and waiting times.
* **Tax & Tip Calculators**: Scripts for calculating gross pay after tax (`Gross Pay After Tax Program ver. 1.1.py`) and meal tips (`Tip Calculator Program.py`).
* **Word Finder & Clear List**: Specialized utility scripts for string searching and list manipulation.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

To run these projects, you will need Python installed along with the following third-party libraries:

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `PyQt6`
* `scipy`
* `scikit-learn` (sklearn)

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib PyQt6 scipy scikit-learn
