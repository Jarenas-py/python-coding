#Shorthand operations is a more versatile way to apply operations on a value that has variable and returning the result back to the same variable. Given the example, shorthand_Sum has a value of 1. Applying the shorthand operation would apply that operation and value to the value of shorthand_Sum and update shorthand_Sum.

shorthand_Sum = 1
shorthand_Sum += 1
print(shorthand_Sum)

shorthand_Product = 5
shorthand_Product *= 5
print(shorthand_Product)
